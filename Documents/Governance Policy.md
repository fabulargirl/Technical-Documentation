# Roles and responsibilities

**Technical Writers responsibilities:**
- Splitting the current documentation into sections for python versions. 
- Add information about compatibility with pandas
- Checking the text description of functions, it should be understandable even to a newbie in programming.
- Checking for code samples under all functions.
Collaboration: Work with developers to understand technical details and update documentation accordingly.

**CSV Library Developers responsibilities:**  
- Writing sample code for all functions in the library.
- Explaining to technical writers the differences of modified functions.
- Validating functions described by technical writers for all versions of python.
- Checking the description for compatibility with pandas.
Collaboration: Work with technical writers to verify accuracy and technical completeness of documentation.

**QA Developers responsibilities:** 
- Adding an error handling section
- Validating written code for use cases.
Collaboration: Working with technical writers to check accuracy and technical completeness of documentation.

# Review cycles

**Frequency:** Documentation should be reviewed and modified when new versions of Python are released, as the library is updated with changes to Python.
**Stages:**
1. The developer describes to the technical writer the changes in the current version
2. Technical writer describes new or changed features to users in clear language
3. Developer writes code samples for use 
# Approval workflow

- Draft: 
	The technical writer drafts the documentation, including updates for new features. The developer describes code examples and error handling.
- Reviewing: 
	Developer checks for technical accuracy.
	The QA department checks the code samples for correctness.
	Once the documentation passes the review, it is approved by the documentation manager.
- Publication: 
	The finalized version is published on the official Python documentation site, labeled with the appropriate Python version.

# Retention or archival rules

Documentation for all versions should be maintained indefinitely, because users may use different versions of python in their work.
